## Linear Model - 1 predictor 

### Generate sample data 

To make it faster consider running the lm model, saving it, and adding aspects of that to the graph, rather than running the lm model twice. 
```{r}

# Parameters 
sample_size <- 400
intercept <- 10
slope <- 3.4
sd <- 5
mean <- 0

x <- mvrnorm(n = sample_size, mu = 0, Sigma = sd, empirical = TRUE) 
y <- intercept + slope*x + mvrnorm(n = sample_size, mu = 0, Sigma = sd, empirical = TRUE) 
df <- tibble(x = x, y = y)

lm <- summary(lm(formula = y ~ x, data = df))

```

### Plot Linear Model

```{r}

ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```
