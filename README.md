## ADDA Interactive GLM App

### Objective

To develop a Shiny app, or suite or apps, to teach and visualise
statistical concepts related to the General Linear Model (i.e., linear
regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, moderation, mediation, logistic
regression, and multilevel modelling).

### Prototype

This project is an extension of an earlier app designed to teach
multilevel modelling, which can be accessed
[here](https://dvanos.shinyapps.io/mlmexplorer/).
